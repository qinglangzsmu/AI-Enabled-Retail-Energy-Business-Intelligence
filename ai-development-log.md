# AI-Assisted Development Log

## Purpose

This document records how AI-assisted development tools are used
throughout the project.

The objective is to understand how AI can improve productivity,
reusability, documentation, testing, and BI development workflows.

AI-generated output is reviewed and validated by the developer before
being incorporated into the project.

## Task

Create a reusable data validation function for checking
missing and duplicate records.

## AI Tool

GitHub Copilot

## AI Contribution

Generated an initial Python implementation containing
validation logic and error handling.

## Human Contribution

Reviewed the generated implementation, simplified the interface,
defined the expected business rules, and added additional validation
conditions.

## Validation

Tested the function using synthetic datasets containing:

- Missing records
- Duplicate records
- Valid records

## Outcome

Created a reusable data-quality validation component.

## Lessons Learned

AI was effective at generating repetitive implementation code,
while business rules and validation requirements still required
human review.
